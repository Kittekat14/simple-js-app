  <h1>Pokémon Deck aka "Pokédex"</h1>
  <h2>Pokémon GO is already 5 years old!</h2>
  <p>Wow! Can you believe that Pokémon GO is already 5 years old now? Although I can't imagine I was that old when I first played it. I was already at university and even us students got caught up in the hype. A fellow student in my history seminar showed it to me. Once, when we were on a field trip to Mainz and Trier, where we were supposed to be exploring ancient and medieval buildings, we played it a lot during our walks, until our batteries failed. Our professor wanted to explore everything on foot anyway. So why not combine the pleasant with the useful? We noticed that pokemon were in different geographical locations according to their type. Water pokemon, for example, were often found on the banks of the Rhine, while grass pokemon were more likely to be found in parks. My friend told me, that she always wanted to find Jigglypuff.</p>
