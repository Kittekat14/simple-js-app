  <h1>Pokémon Deck aka "Pokédex"</h1>
  <h2>Pokémon GO is already 5 years old!</h2>
  <p>Wow! Can you believe that Pokémon GO is already 5 years old now? Although I can't imagine I was that old when I first played it. I was already at university and even us students got caught up in the hype.</p><p>A fellow student in my history seminar showed it to me. Once, when we were on a field trip to Mainz and Trier, where we were supposed to be exploring ancient and medieval buildings, we played it a lot during our walks, until our batteries failed. Our professor wanted to explore everything on foot anyway. So why not combine the pleasant with the useful?</p><p>We noticed that pokemon were in different geographical locations according to their type. <b>Water pokemon</b>, for example, were often found on the banks of the Rhine, while <b>grass pokemon</b> were more likely to be found in parks.</p>My friend always told me: <cite>"I would love to catch Jigglypuff, because it is my favorite Pokémon."</cite></p>
