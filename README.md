# POKEDEX
## Project Description
A small and simple, but easy to understand JavaScript Web-App that enables the user to view a list of 150 Pokémons that is loading data from an external API (via Ajax and fetch method). It even allows to view specific details for each Pokémon by clicking a button with the name of a particular Pokemon, which opens a modal that displays weight, types and abilities of the selected Pokémon. These “Pocket Monsters”, as they are also known in Japan, can be filtered by their name components via an input search field in the upper right corner.
